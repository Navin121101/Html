            <p class="Planet-discription">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days,
            the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods,
            and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's 
            orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun 
            means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At 
            this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically 
            displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. The 
            synodic proximity of Mercury to Earth makes Mercury most of the time Earth's closest planet, despite Venus at times approaching Earth closer 
            than any other planet can</p>

            <p class="Planet-discription">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) 
                planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there 
                are radical differences between the two worlds Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded
                in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system,
                even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough 
                to melt lead.</p>
